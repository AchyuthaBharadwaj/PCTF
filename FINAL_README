program to write attacks ->
This is a php file to write inputs into attackfile.txt. It takes values from POST request and writes it to the file if it contains anything
that is alphanumeric. This is useful to filter out the parameters being sent to us. Include this file and send the parameters to it to run 
this.

patch.php ->
This file contains method to patch and sanitize inputs. All the functions are public and they should be called after including this file in php
script. The value to be sanitized must be passed to the methods.


exploit.py ->
The script is based on the api.py given by TA.  Its basic functions include: retrieving information on victim servicesâ€™ ip, port and flag_id, 
connecting to victim services using pwntool remote function, exploiting through interaction with victim service (this portion need to code during 
the competition), receiving data from victim service and search flag in the data through regular expression.


recovery.py ->
This script checkes our own services every 30 seconds. It connects to local service using pwntool remote function.  If remote function does not 
receive any data, it will copy the backup file and change the configuration using "chmod" and "chown".

SS_Final/filelist.py ->
Get a list of all the files in the directory and return it to the caller function.
SS_Final/find_vuln.py ->
Get a list of files in the directory, add the paths and finally extract data from them. This data is then processed and checked through with vulnerabilities. 
If there is any vulnerability found then list it down for the user to see and fix.

Test_Sanitizer.c ->
This is a test input sanitizer code we wrote that will check for special chars in the input and if there are some special charspresent then program exits. 
We just have to copy the methods into the source file and call check for validation method.
PS: We could not use this in CTF as there were tests that took down our server because some special chars were used in the tests.
